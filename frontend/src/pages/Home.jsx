                My name is Francis Tettey, and I am a final-year Software Engineering student at the University of Leicester. As of September 2025,
                I completed a year-long industrial placement at Sand Technologies where I worked on a team that developed a full-stack application.
                <br /><br />
                Our tech stack included React.js and RestJS for the frontend, FastAPI for a scalable Python-based backend, and PostGIS for relational and geospatial data management.
                We also used KeplerGL and GeoServer for data visualisation.
                <br /><br />
                Notable achievements during my internship include implementing several frontend design refreshes, earning an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification,
                and migrating the application's user management from Keycloak to AWS Cognito. I also significantly improved my debugging skills and my ability to explain technical issues clearly.
                <br /><br />
                My current goal is to graduate with first-class honours and begin a career as a full-stack software engineer.
